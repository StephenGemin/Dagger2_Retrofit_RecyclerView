Dagger2 Dependency Injection with Retrofit and RecyclerView with Kotlin

For anyone who reads this, I've re-written the code from this website 
https://www.journaldev.com/20405/android-dagger-2-retrofit-recyclerview#ui-package.

If you are like me, I transitioned from another background into software programming. I've found dependency injection particiularly 
difficult to wrap my head around.  I've gone through at least 10-15 websites explaining this concept, but it was this article that really 
hit it home for me.  I went through and re-wrote the code step by step.  

Now I say that it's written in Kotlin, but in truth, there is a mix of Kotlin and Java Files.
